        <p>Managing consumer goods in production can be difficult, which can lead to all sort of 
            problems with managing if production is efficient enough, time of shipping products, 
            employee efficiency, etc. This product tracking application will allow organizations 
            to digitally create products with information about production such as materials and 
            time of production, and it will gather data on the efficiency of production for better 
            optimization. Employees will scan a code to log the start time of their task and scan 
            it again to log the end time of their task. The time of each task and the stages of a 
            product will be logged to the online web application for viewing and analysis. With this 
            tool, companies will be able to be better organized and take the next step forward with 
            their manufacturing.</p>
